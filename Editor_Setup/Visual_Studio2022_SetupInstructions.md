## Step 1 - Make sure your computer is ready for Visual Studio

1. **Check the system requirements. These requirements help you know whether your computer supports Visual Studio 2022.**

### Supported Operating Systems

Visual Studio 2022 is supported on the following 64-bit operating systems:
    
- Windows 11 minimum supported OS version or higher: Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations, Enterprise, and   
  Education Supported Windows 11 OS can be found here:Windows 10 Enterprise and Education Support
- Windows 10 minimum supported OS version or higher: Home, Professional, Education, and Enterprise.
  Supported Windows 10 OS can be found here:Windows 10 Enterprise and Education Support
- Windows Server Core 2022
- Windows Server Core 2019
- Windows Server Core 2016
- Windows Server 2022: Standard and Datacenter.*
- Windows Server 2019: Standard and Datacenter.*
- Windows Server 2016: Standard and Datacenter.*
    
### Hardware
    
- ARM64 or x64 processor; Quad-core or better recommended. ARM 32 processors are not supported.
- Minimum of 4 GB of RAM. Many factors impact resources used; we recommend 16 GB RAM for typical professional solutions.
- Windows 365: Minimum 2 vCPU and 8 GB RAM. 4 vCPU and 16 GB of RAM recommended.
- Hard disk space: Minimum of 850 MB up to 210 GB of available space, depending on features installed; 
  typical installations require 20-50 GB of free space. We recommend installing Windows and Visual Studio on a solid-state drive (SSD) to increase performance.
- Video card that supports a minimum display resolution of WXGA (1366 by 768); Visual Studio will work best at a   
  resolution of 1920 by 1080 or higher.
  Minimum resolution assumes zoom, DPI settings, and text scaling are set at 100%. If not set to 100%, minimum resolution should be scaled accordingly. 
  For example, if you set the Windows display ‘Scale and layout’ setting on your Surface Book, which has a 3000x2000 physical display, to 200%, 
  then Visual Studio would see a logical screen resolution of 1500x1000, meeting the minimum 1366x768 requirement.

1. **Make sure that the user performing the installation has administrator permissions on the machine.**

2. **Apply the latest Windows updates. These updates ensure that your computer has both the latest security updates and the required system components for Visual Studio.**

3. **Reboot. The reboot ensures that any pending installs or updates don't hinder your Visual Studio install.**

4. **Free up space. Remove unneeded files and applications from your system drive by, for example, running the Disk Cleanup app.**

## Step 2 - Determine which version and edition of Visual Studio to install

## Step 3 - Initiate the installation

Install Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ (Community Edition for a student or hobbyist)

From your Downloads folder, double-click the bootstrapper named VisualStudioSetup.exe or named something like vs_community.exe to start the installation.
If you receive a User Account Control notice, choose Yes. We'll ask you to acknowledge the Microsoft License Terms and the Microsoft Privacy Statement. Choose Continue.

## Step 4 - Choose workloads

After the Visual Studio Installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting the feature sets—or workloads—that you want. Here's how.

At any time after installation, you can install workloads or components that you didn't install initially. If you have Visual Studio open, 
go to Tools > Get Tools and Features... which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Or, open the Visual Studio Installer from the Start menu. From there, 
you can choose the workloads or components that you wish to install. Then, choose Modify.

## Step 5 - Choose individual components (optional)
If you don't want to use the Workloads feature to customize your Visual Studio installation, or you want to add more components than a workload installs, you can do so by installing or adding individual components from the Individual components tab. Choose what you want, and then follow the prompts.
