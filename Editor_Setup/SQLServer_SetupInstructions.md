# Install SQL Server 

Download Link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads

When you click on the link above you will be brought to a page where you can choose between 
the Developer or the Express Edition

My Suggestion would be to download both so in the future you can set up 2 servers.

- The Express Edition for quick app development and testing (Youtube Tutorials :thumbsup:)
- The Developer Edition for when you actually have complete apps made and you want to 
  keep the programs running on and for storing complete database projects to 
  practice querying databases.
