1. **C# by Microsoft**

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides rich language support for C# and is shipped along with C# Dev Kit. 
Powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server, this extension integrates with open source components like Roslyn and Razor 
to provide rich type information and a faster, more reliable C# experience.

2. **.NET Runtime Install Tool by Microsoft**

This extension provides a unified way for other extensions like the C# and C# Dev Kit extensions to install local, private versions of the .NET Runtime. 
This extension is not intended to be used directly by users to install .NET for development purposes because it only includes 
the .NET Runtime and not the entire .NET SDK.
